## Your Proposal 
### Project description
The DutchX exchange offers a different model for trading. As we analyse current finance protocol, the custom dashboard will integrate with the existing protocol in our platform. Not only we will have the metric from the exchange but we will be able to show the interaction between DutchX and other DeFi protocol that DutchX uses might be inteacting with.

The DutchX dashboard will be implemented on [DAppBoard](https://dappboard.com) website.
